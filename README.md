![csricon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8347c5c9-7c09-4b50-b78d-5918ad9de819) Cyan`s Simple Raiding plugin takes data from the resources inside of any container that can store items like chests, barrels, hoppers, furnaces, etc, this data equates to chest health, when someone attempts to break the
container it will lower the health by 20%, all chests start with 100% health. There is trusting, untrusting and admin commands that come with the plugin.

This plugin was made mainly for my semi-anarchy server to stop players being wiped out easily, it is still in the works as more item data needs to be defined and some features could use rework/ be expanded upon.
